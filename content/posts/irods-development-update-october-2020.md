Title: iRODS Development Update: October 2020
Date: 2020-10-26 10:00
Author: Terrell Russell
Slug: irods-development-update-october-2020
Status: published


First order of the day - we have two new faces around our virtual office.  A new software developer, Markus.  And a new web developer, Bo.  Welcome!   They're going to help us go fast.

Our 4.2.9 work is coming into focus.  Recent commits are related to logical locking, imeta, itouch, and [getting the delay rule context files stored in the catalog](https://groups.google.com/g/irod-chat/c/CsShunUkTqg).

We have released the [Python iRODS Client library, now at v0.8.4](https://github.com/irods/python-irodsclient/releases/tag/v0.8.4), including work on PAM authentication, testing, and stale connection pools.

The C++ REST API is being exercised by a new iRODS Administration GUI being developed in React.  We're excited to share that publicly soon, once there are a few more pieces in place.

We are also working on prototype code for an RDMA connector, alongside the ongoing Lustre integration efforts.

This last month has seen us virtually attend and present at BioIT World and eResearch Australasia.  We'll be at BioData World Congress and Supercomputing 2020 in the next month.  Less travel is easier, but spanning the global timezones from home is definitely not.
